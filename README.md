## Description

Drones are unique tools that allow consumers and organizations alike to explore new areas, capture interesting videos, and increase safety. However, like most tools, commercially available drones can also be misused to carry out mass survillance, or capture images and video of people and locations without permission.

Sentry is a tool designed to detect commercial drones operating on WiFi frequencies (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) by analyzing the MAC addresses of nearby wireless devices constantly. While not perfect, this offers a reasonable level of protection at an extremely low cost. Instead of complex radar systems that can cost tens of thousand of dollars, and Sentry system can run on affordable hardware that most consumers already have laying around.
